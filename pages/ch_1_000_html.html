  <p>HTML is the World Wide Web's core markup language. Originally, HTML was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents. Its general design, however, has enabled it to be adapted, over the subsequent years, to describe a number of other types of documents and even applications. Today, HTML is used to organize the text and other forms of information, that we want to present on the web.</p>
  
	<p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>

	<h5>Semantic correctness</h5>	
	
	<p>Semantic correctness means that all elements are chosen well. <strong>Semantics are front and center with HTML5</strong>, giving meaning to structure of web apps and dynamic web content. This semantic information is critical to assistive technologies. In some cases assistive technologies use semantic information to provide additional functionality. A speech recognition tool might provide a voice command for moving focus to the start of the main element for example. When the appropriate HTML element or attribute is not used, it deprives HTML processors of valuable semantic information. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/dom.html#elements">W3C</a></p>

	<h3>Elements</h3>	
	<p>HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. Each element has a definition that includes the following information: categories, contexts in which this element can be used, content model, ... content attributes, ... <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> interface, ...;</p>

		<figcaption>Anatomy of an HTML Element
			<ul>
				<li><strong>The opening tag</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
				<li><strong>The closing tag</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
				<li><strong>The content</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
				<li><strong>The element</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag and the content together comprise the element.</li>
			</ul>
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
		
	<h5>Empty Elements</h5>	
	<p>Some elements <strong>never contain content</strong>; for example <samp>br</samp>, <samp>hr</samp>, <samp>img</samp>, <samp>meta</samp>. In HTML5 specifically, we do not close empty elements (no end tag). In other markup languages, including HTML5, you can use the shorthand form, combining the start tag and end tag; for example, <samp>br /</samp> or <samp>hr /</samp></p>

	</figure>
  
	<h5>Nesting Elements</h5>
	<p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap, your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!</p>

	<p>Attributes are properties that allow additional information about each elements. All attributes have a quoted value assigned.</p>
	
	<h5>Attribute minimization</h5>
	<p>☛ <strong>HTML5 ONLY</strong> Single-valued attributes are minimized.</p>
	
	<h5>Global attributes</h5>
	<p>Global attributes are common to and may be specified on all HTML elements: <code>accesskey</code>, <code>class</code>, <code>contenteditable</code>, <code>dir</code>, <code>draggable</code>, <code>hidden</code>, <code>id</code>, <code>lang</code>, <code>spellcheck</code>, <code>style</code>, <code>tabindex</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>translate</code></p>

	<h5>Element-specific attributes</h5>
	<p>Some elements have attributes that are specific to the element. For example <samp data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Ordered list" data-ref-link="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ol.asp">ol</samp> element, by default starts with integer number 1; you can change the start value with the attribute <code>start</code> and change the kind of marker to use with attribute <code>type</code>.</p>

	<h2>Defining document structure</h2>
  

	
	<h3>HTML Document</h3>
	
	<p>HTML Document is a text file containing hypertext markup language; interpreted and rendered on the screen by a browser. Various components and concepts are important to understand and keep in mind as you develop web applications. Both web sites and web applications use web pages or, more formally, HTML Documents.</p>
	
	<h3>Document Type</h3>
	
	<p>Every HTML document we create should declare its document type (doctype) in the first line. This will identify which specification of HTML is included so the browser knows how to interpret the markup. With HTML5, the general doctype declaration is
	<br><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html></code><br>
	This is the very first line of code in any HTML page you create. Keep in mind that code examples you find online may contain older outdated or irrelevant approaches.</p>

	<h3>Document Structure</h3>
	
	<p>Each HTML document has a single root element, <code>&lt;html></code>, and is divided into two sections: <code>&lt;head></code> and <code>&lt;body></code>.</p>

	<h3>Head Section</h3>
	
	<p>The purpose of the <code>&lt;head></code> section is to describe the document itself. The children of head element include <code>&lt;meta></code> to describe the document, <code>&lt;link></code> to include stylesheet files and other assets, <code>&lt;styles></code> to embed styles, <code>&lt;script></code> to include scripts, and <code>&lt;title></code> in window tab.</p>

	<h3>Body Section</h3>	
	
	<p>The purpose of the <code>&lt;body></code> section is to organize content for presentation by marking it up with HTML elements. The body element contains all marked up content that is presented to the user.</p>

  <section> <!-- 1.2.3.  Document Object Model (DOM) -->
    <h2>Document Object Model (DOM)</h2>
    <p>The Document Object Model is a platform- and language-neutral interface that will allow programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of documents. The document can be further processed and the results of that processing can be incorporated back into the presented page.</p>
    <p>Elements in the DOM represent things &mdash; objects; that is, they have intrinsic meaning, also known as semantics. The HTMLElement interface holds the object's methods and attributes (properties).  </p>

    <hr>
		

  <h5>Thinking in Objects</h5>
  <p>The procedural paradigm focuses on designing methods. The object-oriented paradigm couples data and methods together into objects. Software design using the object-priented paradigm focuses on objects and operations on objects.</p>
  <p>Objects are the fundamental building blocks of applications from an object-oriented perspective. An object is a self-contained component that contains properties and methods needed to make a certain type of data useful. An object’s properties are what it knows and its methods are what it can do.</p>
  <p>An object represents an entity in the real world that can be distinctly identified. An object has a unique identity, state, and behaviour. The state of an object, also known as its properties or attributes, is represented by data fields with their current values. The behaviour of an object, also known as its actions, is defined by methods. To invoke a method on an object is to ask the object to perform an action. Reference your Java textbook.</p>
   <p>To design classes, you need to explore the relationships among classes. The common relationships among classes are association, aggregation, composition, and inheritance Inheritance enables you to define a general class and extend it to more specialized classes, called subclass, child class, or extended class. The existing class is called a superclass, parent class, or base class. Inheritance is a powerful feature for reusing software.</p>
   
   <h5>The Document Object</h5>
    <p>When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object. The document object is the root node of the HTML document and the "owner" of all other nodes.</p>
    <p>The HTML DOM defines a standard way for accessing and manipulating HTML documents. It presents an HTML document as a <dfn>tree structure</dfn> or a <dfn>hierarchy</dfn>.</p>
    <p>The DOM is a representation of the structure of our HTML page that you can interact with programmatically. An HTML document is a hierarchy of elements (objects). The browser produces an outline based on this hierarchy and displays it to the visitor (user). The browser constructs a DOM that can be used by the developer. The DOM's application programming interface (API) is exposed as objects with properties and methods, enabling you to write Javascript code to interact with HTML elements rendered to the page.</p>
    <p>Our ability to manipulate and create web pages consistently across formats comes from the document object model API. This API defines the order and structure of document files as well as how the file is manipulated to create, edit, or remove contents.</p>

    <hr>
    <h5>DOM Nodes</h5>
    <p>DOM is a collection of nodes arranged in a tree. All nodes are related to each other - a family tree of children, parents, siblings, grandparents, etc.  </p>
    
    <p>In the HTML DOM, everything is a node:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>The document itself is a document node.</li>
     <li>All HTML elements are element nodes.</li>
     <li>All HTML attributes are attribute nodes.</li>
     <li>Text inside HTML elements are text nodes.</li>
     <li>Comments are comment nodes.</li>
   </ul>
     <p>Each element in this tree has exactly one parent, with the exception of the root element, which has none.</p>

    <p>The CSSOM is a map of all CSS selectors and relevant properties for each selector in the form of a tree, with a root node, sibling, descendant, child, and other relationship. The CSSOM is very similar to the DOM. Both of them are part of the critical rendering path which is a series of steps that must happen to properly render a website.</p>

    <p>Make sure that every page on your site has a meta description. Differentiate the descriptions for different pages. Identical or similar descriptions on every page are not helpful.</p>
    <p>Include clearly tagged facts in the description. The meta description doesn't just have to be in sentence format; it's also a great place to include information about the page. For example, news or blog postings can list the author, date of publication, or byline information.</p> 
    
    <blockquote>Use quality descriptions. Finally, make sure your descriptions are truly descriptive. Because the meta descriptions aren't displayed in the pages the user sees, it's easy to let this content slide. But high-quality descriptions can be displayed in Google's search results, and can go a long way to improving the quality and quantity of your search traffic. </blockquote>

    <p>A content model is a description of the element’s expected contents. An HTML element must have contents that match the requirements described in the element’s content model. The contents of an element are its children in the DOM (flow, interactive, embedded, phrasing, meta-data, sectioning, heading).</p>

     <object data="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/images/content-venn.svg" height="188" width="720"><img alt="" height="168" src="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/images/content-venn.svg" width="112"></object>

	<section><!-- 1.5.3. Block and inline behaviour-->
    <h4>Block and inline flow</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>By default, block-level elements begin on new lines. Read more <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements">MDN web docs</a></li>
      
      <li>By default, inline elements stay in line of the parent element. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements">MDN web docs</a></li>
      <li>To determine what content category a particular element belongs to, examine the specifications document.</li>
