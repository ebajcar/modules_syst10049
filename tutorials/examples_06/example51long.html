    <p>Once you understand the fact that source order matters, at some point you will run into a situation where you know that a rule comes later in the stylesheet, but an earlier, conflicting, rule is applied. This is because that earlier rule has a higher specificity â€” it is more specific, and therefore is being chosen by the browser as the one that should style the element.</p>
    <p>As we saw earlier in this lesson, a class selector has more weight than an element selector, so the properties defined on the class will override those applied directly to the element</p>
    <p title="Message">Something to note here is that although we are thinking about selectors and the rules that are applied to the thing they select, it isn't the entire rule which is overwritten, only the properties which are the same.</p>
    <p>This behavior helps avoid repetition in your CSS. A common practice is to <span>define generic styles for the basic elements, and then create classes for those which are different</span>. For example, in the stylesheet below we have defined generic styles for level 2 headings, and then created some classes which change only some of the properties and values. The values defined initially are applied to all headings, then the more specific values are applied to the headings with the classes.</p>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <p>CSS pseudo classes:  using existing classes without the need to adding the class attribute. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>creating class increases the size of the DOM, which affects performance (the larger the DOM the longer it takes to process, and </li>
      <li>using created class is more prone to errors (you could easily miss adding the class attribute somewhere). In this example, you would need to add the class attribute to 75 paragraphs.</li>
